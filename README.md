OpenMCDF
========

A fork of the OpenMCDF library on SourceForge (https://sourceforge.net/projects/openmcdf/)

Note: I have recently added a new branch based on the Dev branch of the SF project as this has the most recent code.  The original Master branch was based on the latest release branch at the time.  Only recently did I realise that the stable release I had used was far behind the development.

So I intend on removing/archiving the Master branch in favour of the new branch.  For those who are using this code, try the new branch to confirm that it still functions correctly.  Note that there a few method name changes etc but the required changes should be straight forward.  Alternatively I have released a new version of the OpenMCDF-Forked nuget package including an upload of the symbols to symbolsource.
